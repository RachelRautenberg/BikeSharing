# BikeSharing
Mod 14

### OVERVIEW

New York City has a well running CitiBike program.  Recently interest has been expressed in beginning a similar bike sharing business in Des Moines.  In order to secure investor backing an analysis of the New York City program was completed utilizing one month's data. There are many valuable points to be gleaned from the review of this data as well as some important takeaways that should be considered for implementation in Des Moines.


### RESULTS
The visuals below can be viewed in more detail and with interactivity at the follwing: [NYC CitiBike Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rachel.rautenberg/viz/NYCCitiBikeChallenge_Mod14/Story1?publish=yes)

Two things to note about users; the majority are male and the majority are subscribers.  This information can be used from two angles; the first is the ensure there are more bikes to fit a male customer since there is likely to be higher use by them. The second angle is to consider this in the marketing plan by offerings "Gals Go Riding" days or weekends to increase interest. While it is highly likely that more bikes to fit males are needed, we would want to make sure there are enough bikes to fit females. Bike size / availability to need was not assesed for this analysis.  Noting that the majority of users are subscribers does not affect the various bike needs, it should come in to consideration when developing the pricing plan.

An assumption can be made based off of peak hours use, that bikes are heavily used before work or even to get to work, then again to get home or right after work. There is potential to offer day hour discounts to entice mid-day use. We see that same trend when looking across weekdays as well.

Furthermore, subscribing males show the most prominent use all week, with non-subscribing customer use being consistent across gender.

Now that we understand a bit more about the customer base and usagees, let's look further at how station placement is likely to have a role in usage. The following two visuals will show tope starting and ending locations for NYC CitiBike. Understanding the draw to particular stations will be necessary in determing best placement for stations in Des Moines. Knowing what start and end stations are most heavily used in NYC give us great starting ground to ask questions - are these bigger bike stations, are they closer to work places, closer to residences, closer to tourist areas?  Having these answers will provide solid direction to some key locations to have bike stations in our model.

Finally, when all is said and done, the long term plans should understand that bikes need to be maintained and that heavier usage will mean more wear and tear on some bikes than others. There is a wide range of utilization, but generally consistent with pockets of more heavily used.  I suggest a rotation plan to not only remove these bikes for routine repair, but also then return to a lower used station for continued use.  A rotation plan should provide generally more even bike utilization and provide means for a more consistent repair and replacement plan for the organization.

### Summary

NYC and Des Moines are two very different areas, but as long as a bike sharing plan is scaled approriately for the area, we have some great data to develop a full business plan, including key points for marketing plans, pricing plans, and long term sustainability.
